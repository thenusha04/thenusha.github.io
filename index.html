    <h3>Java game project</h3>
    <p>
	My Java game project is a 2D game which has four levels that get more challenging after each level. The challenges the user will encounter when playing the game are in level 1 they have to avoid the asteroids and collect the aliens. In level 2 there is an additional collectible and level 3 has an additional enemy which are the laserballs so the user has more obstacles to avoid. The final level has platforms more spread out which makes it difficult for the user to move from platform to platform in addition to all the previous obstacles. in each level there is a portal to transfer the spaceship at the end of each game to the next level. each level is different from each other as there is different background music, background image and platforms for each aswell as an increase of collectibles and enemies as the levels increase. Once the spaceship is hit by the enemies the lives go down and each level only has a total of five levels.once the spaceship touches the collectibles there is sound effects to confirm to the user aswell as the points increasing. Overall I have created a 2D game whilst incorporating object orienting programming and gui.
